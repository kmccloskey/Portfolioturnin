					A brief history of how I ended up here.  It all started with my mother.
				</h1>
				<p class="paragraph">
					When I was young, we had our first family computer.  My mother seemed like an expert at the time and all I wanted to do was learn.  At the time I was mostly interested in the hardware, how things worked together, and how to build my own.  By the time I was thirteen I had, sortof, built my own computer.  Everything fit together, it just didn't work.  From that point forward, computers were a love and at the time, I thought a hobby.
					<br></br>
					After graduating H.S. I went to be an electrition; didn't like it.  I was a martial arts instructor and truely enjoyed it; unfortunately, the money made me persue other options.  Next, I was a personal trainer; I just didn't enjoy the lifestyle.  At this point, I decided a job was not something you enjoyed, it was something you just did and I fell into a great position working for Macy's.  Four years later, it was time to make my vocation something I really loved, computers, and this is what has led me to NYCDA and following the path of a Web Developer.
