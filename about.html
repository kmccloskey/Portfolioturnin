					A brief history of how I ended up here . . .
				</h1>
				<p class="paragraph">
					It all started with my mother.  When I was eleven, we got our first family computer.  Mom seemed like an expert at the time and all I wanted to do was learn.  For years I was mostly interested in the hardware, how things worked, and how to build my own computer.  By the time I was thirteen I had, sortof, built my own computer.  Everything fit together, it just didn't work.  From that point forward, computers were a love of mine. Back then, I never thought it would be more than just a hobby.
					<br></br>
					After graduating H.S. I went to be an electrician; didn't like it.  Next, I became a martial arts instructor and truly enjoyed it; unfortunately, the lack of money led me to pursue other options.  I then tried out the personal trainer lifestyle; wasn't a fan.  At this point in my life, I decided a job was not something you enjoyed, it was something you just did.  I fell into a great position working for Macy's as a Distribution Manager but quickly became unfulfilled.  Four years later, it was time to make my vocation something I really loved, computers. This is what has led me to NYCDA and following the path of a Web Developer.
